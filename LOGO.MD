# Snipu

Snipu is an app that helps users store, organize, and share their code snippets efficiently. Tagline: _Your Collection of Code Snippets_.

## Logo Redesign

The old logo was described as "boring," so two new logos were created to bring a modern, tech-inspired look

### Logo Directory

The logo files are located at:

- `./LOGO/snipLOGO.png`
- `./LOGO/LOGO2.png`

## Getting Started

To view or use the new logos, navigate to the `./LOGO` directory and select the desired file.
